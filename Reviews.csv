Ramos,0,0,3,1213142400,Prefer other flavors,i took one and said good russet potato chip but i found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste a bit oily and overcooked it may be because i am use to eating their great tasting a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductb000g6q4gmkettle chips spicy thai 2ounce bags pack of 24a or perhaps because all the chips in the bags i received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning it is obvious the chips are flavored but if i did not read the bag i would never have thought it had cheddar flavor and i love new york cheddar the flavoring included parmesan cheddar blue cheese garlic and other spices a good chip even when overcooked but i do not plan to buy them again

Ramos,0,0,5,1212451200,These will be habit forming!,i took one and said good russet potato chip but where is the flavoring then all of a sudden within seconds it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy as close to thai food as a potato chip can get  these chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming the flavoring included garlic ginger jalapeno cilantro and other spices and it just felt great to eat these i will buy these again these were a treat

Nichols ""upteeajn2""",0,0,2,1210809600,Good and tangy,i agree with the other review these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums the chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the saltvinegar combo unfortunately every bag i received in that case was over cooked they were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag they definitely need to improve that

495,B000G6RYNE,A2C5BWOM7329UD,Jason T. Stevens,0,0,5,1203465600,Addictive,these are the best potato chips ive ever tasted  its easy to go through half of a bag without stopping  the texturecrunchiness is just perfect as is the salt and vinegar combination  i dont know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips ive ever had but they do  and judging from the nutrition facts they seem to be healthier too  theyre somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c which could be because they dont skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normalbr br and if you like these all of the kettle chips are great
496,B000G6RYNE,APGAA43E3WPN7,Darren,0,0,5,1201392000,amazing chips,i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them they are really amazing i love cheddar too but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor i recommend them
497,B000G6RYNE,ABR7HU5H1KNE,Keith,0,0,5,1196726400,Best Chip Ever,this is easily the best potato chip that i have ever had  look at the ingredients  ginger and 3 types of hot pepper  how can you go wrongbr br obviously not for you if you dont like spicy food but if you do like spicy food youll probably love these  they have that hotwithahintofsweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of thai food
